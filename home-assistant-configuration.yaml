# Home Assistant Configuration Example for iLink Lights
# Add this to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml or use the MQTT integration UI
#
# IMPORTANT: The device "id" in your .env file MUST match the topic names below!
# Example: If your device has id="living_room", use topics "ilink/living_room/state" and "ilink/living_room/set"

light:
  # First device - replace "living_room" with your device ID from .env
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Living Room Light"
    unique_id: "ilink_living_room"
    state_topic: "ilink/living_room/state"
    command_topic: "ilink/living_room/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    color_temp: true
    schema: json
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true

  # Second device - replace "bedroom" with your device ID from .env
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Bedroom Light"
    unique_id: "ilink_bedroom"
    state_topic: "ilink/bedroom/state"
    command_topic: "ilink/bedroom/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    color_temp: true
    schema: json
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true

# To add more devices, copy one of the entries above and:
# 1. Change the "name" to something descriptive
# 2. Change the "unique_id" to be unique (e.g., "ilink_kitchen")
# 3. Change the topic names to match your device ID (e.g., "ilink/kitchen/state")
# 4. Make sure the device ID in your .env file matches the topic name!

# Alternative: Use MQTT Discovery (if supported)
# The bridge can be extended to support Home Assistant MQTT Discovery protocol
# This would automatically create entities in Home Assistant
