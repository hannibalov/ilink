# Home Assistant Configuration Example for iLink Lights
# Add this to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml or use the MQTT integration UI

# Example MQTT Light configuration for a single iLink device
# Replace 'light1' with your device ID and adjust the topic prefix if needed

light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Living Room Light"
    unique_id: "ilink_light1"
    state_topic: "ilink/light1/state"
    command_topic: "ilink/light1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    color_temp: true
    schema: json
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true

# If you have multiple devices, add multiple entries:
#  - platform: mqtt
#     name: "Bedroom Light"
#     unique_id: "ilink_light2"
#     state_topic: "ilink/light2/state"
#     command_topic: "ilink/light2/set"
#     brightness: true
#     rgb: true
#     color_temp: true
#     schema: json
#     optimistic: false
#     qos: 1
#     retain: true

# Alternative: Use MQTT Discovery (if supported)
# The bridge can be extended to support Home Assistant MQTT Discovery protocol
# This would automatically create entities in Home Assistant
