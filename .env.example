# Device Configuration (JSON array)
# Each device needs: id, name, macAddress, targetChar (optional), statusChar (optional)
# IMPORTANT: Each device MUST have a unique "id" - this is used in MQTT topics!
# Example with one device:
# DEVICES=[{"id":"living_room","name":"Living Room Light","macAddress":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","targetChar":"a040","statusChar":"a042"}]
#
# Example with multiple devices:
# DEVICES=[
#   {"id":"living_room","name":"Living Room Light","macAddress":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","targetChar":"a040","statusChar":"a042"},
#   {"id":"bedroom","name":"Bedroom Light","macAddress":"11:22:33:44:55:66","targetChar":"a040","statusChar":"a042"}
# ]
